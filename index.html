        <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
        <ul class="about__timeline">
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947)</li>
          <li><strong>1931</strong> -  Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> -  Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself". In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services</li>
          <li><strong>1941</strong> -  In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. </li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> -  In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery  for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber  machine. </li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> -  In January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch </li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> -  On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. </li>
        </ul>

        “Of course, machines can’t think as people do. A machine is different from a person. Hence, they think differently. The interesting question is, just because something, uh.. thinks differently from you, does that mean it’s not thinking?”
